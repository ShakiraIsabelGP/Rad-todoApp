For example:\n\n   ```\n   [:list/id :list/name {:list/items [:item/id :item/complete? :item/label]}]\n   ```\n\n   will create a normalizing query that expects the top-level values to be normalized by `:list/id` and the nested\n   items to be normalized by `:item/id`. If there is more than one ID in your props, make sure the *first* one is\n   the one to use for normalization.\n\n   The `top-component-options` becomes the options map of the component.\n\n   You can include :componentName to push the resulting anonymous component definition into the component registry, which\n   is needed by some parts of Fulcro, like UISM.\n\n   NOTE: `nc` is recursive, and *does* compose if you want to name the components at various levels.
