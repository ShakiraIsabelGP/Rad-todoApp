Report rendering is pluggable, so reports can be quite varied. The general\n  definition of a report is a component that loads data and displays it, possibly paginates, sorts and\n  filters it, but for which interactions are done via custom mutations (disable, delete, sort) or reloads.\n\n  Reports can customize their layout via plugins, and the layout can then allow futher nested customization of element\n  render. For example, it is trivial to create a layout renderer that is some kind of graph, and then use loaded data\n  as the input for that display.\n\n  Customizing the report's state machine and possibly wrapping it with more complex layout controls makes it possible\n  to create UI dashboards and much more complex application features.\n  \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros com.fulcrologic.rad.report))\n  (:require\n    #?@(:clj\n        [[clojure.pprint :refer [pprint]]\n         [cljs.analyzer :as ana]])\n    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]\n    [clojure.string :as str]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro-i18n.i18n :refer [tr]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application :as app]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations :as m :refer [defmutation]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.data-fetch :as df]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.routing.dynamic-routing :as dr]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.ui-state-machines :as uism :refer [defstatemachine]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.do-not-use :refer [deep-merge]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.merge :as merge]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.normalized-state :as fstate]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.attributes :as attr]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.control :as control :refer [Control]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.form :as form]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.options-util :as opts :refer [?! debounce]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.report-options :as ro]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.routing :as rad-routing]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.routing.history :as history]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.type-support.date-time :as dt]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.type-support.decimal :as math]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.picker-options :as picker-options]\n    [edn-query-language.core :as eql]\n    [taoensso.encore :as enc]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]))\n\n(defn report-ident\n  \"Returns the ident of a RAD report.
