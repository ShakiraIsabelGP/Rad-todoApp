These functions give client-server agreement on dealing with common\n   date/time processing that happens with respect to UI controls. There is a general formatting function that uses\n   Java DateTimeFormatter on the JVM for server-side, but in order to keep the UI code a light as possible that formatter\n   is hand-written using the built-in browser Intl function (which has the locale data for many locales and does not\n   bloat your js file).\n\n   As such the `formatter` from this namespace is not completely isomophic in CLJ vs CLJS, since in CLJ that formatter\n   can be used for general parsing, but in CLJS it cannot. This should not generally be a problem because the parsing\n   you usually need in the UI is for date controls, and there are functions for ISO parsing that work just fine without\n   needing locale data.\n  \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros [com.fulcrologic.rad.type-support.date-time]))\n  (:require\n    #?(:cljs [com.fulcrologic.rad.type-support.js-joda-base])\n    [clojure.string :as str]\n    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.locale :as locale]\n    [com.fulcrologic.guardrails.core :refer [>defn >def => ?]]\n    [cljc.java-time.instant :as instant]\n    [cljc.java-time.day-of-week :as java-time.day-of-week]\n    [cljc.java-time.local-date-time :as ldt]\n    [cljc.java-time.local-date :as ld]\n    [cljc.java-time.local-time :as lt]\n    [cljc.java-time.zoned-date-time :as zdt]\n    [cljc.java-time.period :as period]\n    [cljc.java-time.duration :as duration]\n    [cljc.java-time.zone-id :as zone-id]\n    [cljc.java-time.format.date-time-formatter :as dtf]\n    [taoensso.encore :as enc]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]\n    [cljc.java-time.month :refer [january february march april may june july august september october november december]]\n    #?@(:clj  []\n        :cljs [[goog.object :as gobj]\n               [com.fulcrologic.rad.type-support.js-date-formatter :as jdf]\n               [java.time :refer [Duration LocalTime LocalDateTime LocalDate ZonedDateTime Period Instant]]\n               [com.fulcrologic.rad.type-support.ten-year-timezone]\n               [goog.date.duration :as g-duration]]))\n  #?(:cljs (:import [goog.i18n DateTimeParse])\n     :clj  (:import java.io.Writer\n                    [java.util Date Locale]\n                    [java.time Duration Instant LocalDate LocalDateTime LocalTime Period ZonedDateTime]\n                    [java.time.format DateTimeFormatter])))\n\n(>def ::month (s/or :month #{january february march april may june july august september october\n                             november december}))\n(>def ::day (s/int-in 1 32))\n(>def ::year (s/int-in 1970 3000))\n(>def ::hour (s/int-in 0 24))\n(>def ::minute (s/int-in 0 60))\n(>def ::instant (s/with-gen #(instance?
