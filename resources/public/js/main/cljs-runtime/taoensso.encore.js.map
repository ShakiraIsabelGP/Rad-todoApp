Note: !?, not ?!.\n    foo$    - Fn that's notably expensive to compute (e.g. hits db).\n    foo_    - Dereffable val (e.g. atom, volatile, delay, etc.).\n    _       - Unnamed val.\n    _foo    - Named but unused val.\n    ?foo    - Optional val (emphasize that val may be nil).\n    foo*    - A variation of `foo` (e.g. `foo*` macro vs `foo` fn).\n    -foo    - Public implementation detail or intermediate (e.g. uncoerced) val.\n    >foo    - Val \\\"to foo\\\" (e.g. >sender, >host), or fn to put/coerce/transform.\n    <foo    - Val \\\"from foo\\\" (e.g. <sender, <host), or fn to take/coerce/transform.\n    ->foo   - Fn to put/coerce/transform.\"\n\n  {:author \"Peter Taoussanis (@ptaoussanis)\"}\n\n  (:refer-clojure :exclude\n   [if-let if-some if-not when when-not when-some when-let cond defonce\n    run! some? ident? float? boolean? uri? indexed? bytes?\n    int? pos-int? neg-int? nat-int?\n    simple-ident?   qualified-ident?\n    simple-symbol?  qualified-symbol?\n    simple-keyword? qualified-keyword?\n    format update-in merge merge-with\n    memoize])\n\n  #?(:clj\n     (:require\n      [clojure.string  :as str]\n      [clojure.set     :as set]\n      [clojure.java.io :as io]\n      [clojure.walk    :as walk :refer [macroexpand-all]]\n      ;; [clojure.core.async    :as async]\n      [clojure.tools.reader.edn :as edn]\n      [taoensso.truss :as truss])\n\n     :cljs\n     (:require\n      [clojure.string      :as str]\n      [clojure.set         :as set]\n      ;; [cljs.core.async  :as async]\n      [cljs.reader]\n      [cljs.tools.reader.edn :as edn]\n      ;;[goog.crypt.base64 :as base64]\n      [goog.object         :as gobj]\n      [goog.string         :as gstr]\n      [goog.string.format]\n      [goog.string.StringBuffer]\n      [goog.events         :as gevents]\n      [goog.net.XhrIo      :as gxhr]\n      [goog.net.XhrIoPool  :as gxhr-pool]\n      [goog.Uri.QueryData  :as gquery-data]\n      [goog.net.EventType]\n      [goog.net.ErrorCode]\n      [taoensso.truss :as truss]))\n\n  #?(:clj\n     (:import\n      [java.util Date Locale TimeZone]\n      [java.text SimpleDateFormat]\n      [java.util.concurrent CountDownLatch]\n      ;; [org.apache.commons.codec.binary Base64]\n      )\n\n     :cljs\n     (:require-macros\n      [taoensso.encore :as enc-macros :refer\n       [have have! have? compile-if\n        if-let if-some if-not when when-not when-some when-let cond defonce\n        cond! catching -if-cas! now-dt* now-udt* now-nano* -gc-now?\n        name-with-attrs deprecated new-object]])))\n\n(def encore-version [3 1 0])\n\n(comment \"\u2234 \u2235 \u2115 \u2124 \u211d \u221e \u2260 \u2208 \u2209 \u21d2\u21d4 \u2192 \u00d7 \u2283\u2282 \u2287\u2286 \u2261 \u00ac \u2200 \u2203 \u221d\"\n  (set! *unchecked-math* :warn-on-boxed)\n  (set! *unchecked-math* false))\n\n(do ; Bootstrap Truss aliases\n  (defmacro have  [& args] `(taoensso.truss/have  ~@args))\n  (defmacro have?
