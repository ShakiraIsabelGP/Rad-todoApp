com.fulcrologic.rad.authorization\n  \"Authentication and Authorization Support.\n\n  WARNING: This part of RAD will not be standardized for some time. You will need to roll your own particular auth\n  system, which can easily plug into the various hooks in Forms and Reports (e.g. field formatters, read-only checks, etc).\n  If necessary you can simply make new wrapper macros around these if/when boilerplate becomes an issue. After all, forms\n  and reports are just very thin macros around Fulcro's `defsc` that pre-fill component options for you.\n  We hope the community will provide plugins for this, but generalized Auth is simply beyond the scope of RAD at this time due\n  to time/resource constraints. Community members are highly encouraged to write their own auth plugin libraries for\n  RAD, and we'll be glad to link to them on the main project pages.\n\n  The implementation in this namespace is only partially written, and can satisfy some simple needs. The original idea\n  was that each attribute would be under some authority (the owner of that data). These would be identified by\n  user-generated keyword names.\n\n  The state machine in this namespace was then meant to be used as a way to check which authorities had been authenticated\n  against, so that incremental data access could be obtained over time as the user moved among features in the application.\n  Each authority requires that the developer provide a component that can be used as the source of the mutation names\n  and (optionally) UI for obtaining data from the user like passwords.\n\n  This at least gives you the ability to control if the current user is at least *known* to the authority in question, but\n  even this requires some integration with the network remotes of your application (are you using cookies? JWT? etc.).\n\n  Also: *Real* Data access has to be ultimately controlled by the data owner. Therefore much of the real work needs to be\n  done work at the network/database layer.\n\n  Securing a real application needs the following (most of which RAD does NOT provide a default implementation for):\n\n  * A way to auth against a server to establish a session.\n  * A Pathom parser plugin that can check the query/mutation to see if it should be allowed.\n  ** Optionally: granular query security, where individual attributes can be redacted. This would allow the same\n  UI to be shown for users in different roles, and simple elision at the server can then easily be used to affect field/column\n  visibility in the client.\n\n  Some ideas around possible implementations can be found in this package's source directory as auth.adoc.\n  \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros com.fulcrologic.rad.authorization))\n  (:require\n    [clojure.set :as set]\n    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]\n    [clojure.walk :as walk]\n    [com.fulcrologic.guardrails.core :refer [>defn => ? >def]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application :as app]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp :refer [defsc]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.ui-state-machines :as uism :refer [defstatemachine]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.attributes :as attr :refer [new-attribute]]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]))\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n;; PUBLIC API\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n\n(def machine-id ::auth-machine)\n\n(defsc Session [_ _]\n  {:query [::provider\n           ::status\n           '*]\n   :ident [::authorization ::provider]})\n\n(defn verified-authorities\n  \"Returns the providers that are currently authenticated.\"\n  [app-ish]\n  (let [state-map (app/current-state app-ish)\n        env       (uism/state-machine-env state-map machine-id)]\n    (uism/retrieve env :authenticated)))\n\n(defn authenticate!\n  \"Start an authentication sequence for the given provider, and report results to the source-machine-id.\n\n  Sends and :event/authenticated or :event/authentication-failed to that source machine when done.\"\n  [app-ish provider source-machine-id]\n  (uism/trigger! app-ish machine-id :event/authenticate {:source-machine-id source-machine-id\n                                                         :provider          provider}))\n\n(defn logout!\n  \"Force logout on the given provider.\"\n  [app-ish provider]\n  (uism/trigger! app-ish machine-id :event/logout {:provider provider}))\n\n(defn authenticate\n  \"Start an authentication sequence for the given provider, and report results to the source-machine-id.
