complexity that were inherited from Fulcro 2 in the standard tx processing.\n\n   See `with-synchronous-transactions` for how to install it.\n\n   This tx processing system does as much work synchronously as possible, though it does try to preserve the\n   call-order *semantics* of the standard transaction processing: That is to say that if the optimistic action\n   of a transaction submits a new transaction then that new submission will run *after* the current already-in-progress\n   transaction has finished processing:\n\n   ```\n   (defmutation g [_]\n     (action [{:keys [state]}] (swap! state ...))\n     (ok-action [{:keys [app]}] (transact! app [(h)]))\n     (remote [_] true))\n\n   (defmutation f [_]\n     (action [{:keys [state app]}]\n       (swap! state ...)\n       (transact! app [(g)])))\n\n   ...\n   (dom/a {:onClick (fn []\n                      (transact! this [(f {:x 1})])\n                      (transact! this [(f {:x 2})])\n                      (transact! this [(f {:x 3})])))\n   ```\n\n   A user clicking the above link with std processing could see any of the following:\n\n   ```\n   f,f,f,g,g,g,h,h,h\n   f,f,f,g,h,g,g,h,h\n   f,f,f,g,g,h,g,h,h\n   etc.\n   ```\n\n   In sync tx processing, you would more likely see:\n\n   ```\n   f,g,f,g,f,g,h,h,h\n   ```\n\n   because there is *no guarantee* in Fulcro's semantics about the space between two calls to `transact!`. If your\n   application relies on the groupings that happen with the standard tx processing (submissions while holding a thread\n   go into the queue first) then your application may break when you switch to sync processing.\n\n   Note that transactions *are* treated as atomically as possible. So, if you want a specific grouping you should submit\n   it as a single tx:\n\n   ```\n   (transact! [(f) (g)])\n   (transact! [(f) (g)])\n   ```\n\n   is guaranteed to do `f,g,f,g`, and never `f,f,g,g`, though it is still possible to see `f,g,h,f,g,h`.\n\n   This sync transaction processing system allows you to push most (if not all) behavior of even nested transactions into a single\n   synchronous operation. This will lead to significant improvements in the snappiness of the UI for optimistic operation\n   and should also reduce over-rendering (multiple calls to render due to multiple async operations).\n\n   If your remote is mocked as a synchronous operation, then you can also leverage this tx processor to enable\n   completely synchronous testing of your headless Fulcro application.\n\n   WARNING: This tx processing system does *not* support:\n\n   * `ptransact!`: Pessimistic transactions are a legacy feature of Fulcro 2 that is no longer necessary. New\n   applications should not use the feature, and this sync tx processing system does not support it. The call\n   will succeed, but will behave as a normal `transact!`.\n   \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tx-processing.synchronous-tx-processing :refer [in-transaction]]))\n  (:require\n    [clojure.set :as set]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.do-not-use :as futil]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.lookup :as ah]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.scheduling :as sched]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tempid :as tempid]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tx-processing :as txn]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tx-processing.batched-processing :as btxn]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.raw.components :as rc]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.inspect.inspect-client :as inspect :refer [ido ilet]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations :as m]\n    [edn-query-language.core :as eql]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]))\n\n(defonce apps-in-tx (atom {}))\n\n(declare run-queue! available-work?)\n\n(defn current-thread-id\n  \"Get the current thread id on the JVM.

Transactions are not currently batched, and *pessimistic transaction are NOT supported*.\n\n  This plug-in attempts to do as much work as possible synchronously, including the processing of \\\"remotes\\\" that\n  can behave synchronously. This processing system\n  preserves transactional ordering semantics for nested submissions, but cannot guarantee that the overall sequence of\n  operations will exactly match what you'd see if using the standard tx processing.\n\n  The options map you can pass to `transact!` supports most of the same things as the standard tx processing, with the significant exception of\n  `:optimistic? false` (pessimistic transactions). It also *always* assumes synchronous operation, though the\n  `synchronous?` option (if used) does imply that only the current component should be refreshed in the UI as an additinoal\n  optimization.\n\n  - `:ref` - ident. The component ident to include in the transaction env.\n  - `:component` - React element. The instance of the component that should appear in the transaction env.\n  - `:synchronous?` - When true, causes the rendering to only refresh the calling component (if possible), since the implication\n  is for fast-as-possible refresh semantics, even though this tx processing is already sync.\n  - `:refresh` - A hint. Vector containing idents (of components) and keywords (of props). Things that have changed and should be re-rendered\n    on screen. Only necessary when the underlying rendering algorithm won't auto-detect, such as when UI is derived from the\n    state of other components or outside of the directly queried props. Interpretation depends on the renderer selected:\n    The ident-optimized render treats these as \\\"extras\\\".\n  - `:only-refresh` - A hint. Vector of idents/keywords.  If the underlying configured rendering algorithm supports it: The\n    components using these are the *only* things that will be refreshed in the UI, and they may be refreshed immediately on\n    `transact!`. This can be used to avoid the overhead of looking for stale data when you know exactly what\n    you want to refresh on screen as an extra optimization. Idents are *not* checked against queries.\n\n  If the `options` include `:ref` (which comp/transact! sets), then it will be auto-included on the `:refresh` list.\n\n  Returns the transaction ID of the submitted transaction.\n  \"\n  ([app] (with-synchronous-transactions app nil))\n  ([app batching-remotes]\n   (let [remotes          (-> app :com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/runtime-atom deref\n                            :com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/remotes keys)\n         send-queues      (zipmap remotes (repeatedly #(atom [])))\n         batching-enabled (zipmap batching-remotes (repeat true))]\n     (-> app\n       (assoc-in [:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/config :batching-enabled] batching-enabled)\n       (update :com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/algorithms assoc\n         :com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithm/tx! submit-sync-tx!\n         :com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithm/abort! abort!)\n       (assoc ::config {::submission-queue      (atom [])\n                        ::post-processing-steps (atom [])\n                        ::active-queue          (atom [])\n                        ::send-queues           send-queues})))))\n"]}
