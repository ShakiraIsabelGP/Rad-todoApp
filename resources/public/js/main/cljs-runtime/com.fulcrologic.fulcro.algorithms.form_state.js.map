com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.form-state\n  \"Functions that assist with supporting form editing/checking/diffing in Fulcro UI.  These functions work\n  by making a pristine copy of your entity, and tracking what fields have been touched.  You are responsible\n  for triggering these various states by marking fields as complete (`mark-complete!`), telling it to\n  copy the data to/from pristine (e.g. `entity->pristine`), and by asking for out-of-date data for the current\n  vs. pristine copy (`dirty-fields`).\n\n  There is also support for detecting which fields have been marked complete and are dirty.\n\n  Validation can be done via Clojure spec (not recommended), or by defining your own field validation functions via\n  `make-validator` (recommended). This general-purpose validation factory function can easily be used to create more\n  automated validation factories that can be more configuration-driven, but this is left as an exercise for the community.\n\n  Specs are not recommended because forms commonly have multi-field dependencies that simply are\n  not well-supported, and sometimes the use of things like Fulcro tempids leads to specs that you'd\n  rather not have on your server. Use of spec really boils down to your intention for those\n  spec (i.e. hard validation of final database value vs. potential runtime look of the data as\n  it is manipulated). Specs that include \\\"state\\\" information will cause you more pain than\n  you want, though you can certainly leverage specs anywhere it makes sense using the validator factory.\n\n  IMPORTANT: This namespace is about *(possibly recursive) form data management*. Rendering and\n  such are not part of the stated intention.
