com.fulcrologic.rad.blob\n  \"Support for dealing with binary large objects (e.g. file upload, storage, and retrieval of images, documents, etc.)\n\n  To use this support you must:\n\n  - Add wrap-persist-images from this ns to your form save middleware\n  - Install the Fulcro Ring middleware `file-upload/wrap-mutation-file-uploads`.\n  - Configure an HTTP remote on the client with `file-upload/wrap-file-upload` HTTP remote request middleware.\n  - Add the and install the `upload-file` mutation from this ns into your pathom resolver.\n  - Add `::blob/temporary-store` to your Pathom env.\n  - Add a `::blob/stores` map to associate store names to Storage components to your Pathom env.\n  - Configure attributes that will handle files. This support assumes some storage adapter will store the URL\n  of the file uploaded, and the file data will go in some other store (e.g. S3, disk, etc.). So, you configure\n  a to-one string attribute with:\n  ** The form field style to use a renderer that supports file uploads.\n  ** ::blob/store to indicate the identifer of an implementation of blob-storage/Storage. \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros com.fulcrologic.rad.blob))\n  (:require\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.attributes :as attr]\n    [com.fulcrologic.rad.options-util :refer [narrow-keyword]]\n    [edn-query-language.core :as eql]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp :refer [defsc]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.raw.components :as rc]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations :as m :refer [defmutation]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.form-state :as fs]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.normalized-state :as fns]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.do-not-use :refer [deep-merge]]\n    [clojure.core.async :as async]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.networking.file-upload :as file-upload]\n    #?@(:cljs [[goog.crypt :as crypt]\n               [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.networking.http-remote :as net]]\n        :clj  [[com.fulcrologic.rad.blob-storage :as storage]\n               [clojure.pprint :refer [pprint]]\n               [clojure.java.io :as jio]])\n    [clojure.string :as str])\n  (:import\n    #?(:clj  (org.apache.commons.codec.digest DigestUtils)\n       :cljs [goog.crypt Sha256])))\n\n(defn url-key [k] (narrow-keyword k \"url\"))\n(defn progress-key [k] (narrow-keyword k \"progress\"))\n(defn status-key [k] (narrow-keyword k \"status\"))\n(defn filename-key [k] (narrow-keyword k \"filename\"))\n(defn size-key [k] (narrow-keyword k \"size\"))\n\n(defn file-sha256\n  \"Finds the SHA256 from the given Blob/File\n\n  Returns an async channel that will eventually contain the hash or nil (if the input type was not understood).\"\n  [blob]\n  #?(:clj\n     (async/go\n       (async/<!\n         (async/thread\n           (with-open [in (jio/input-stream (jio/as-file blob))]\n             (DigestUtils/sha256Hex in)))))                 ;\n     :cljs\n     (let [c       (async/chan)\n           digest  (fn [hasher bytes] (.update hasher bytes) (.digest hasher))\n           handler (fn [evt]\n                     (let [buffer (.. evt -target -result)\n                           hash   (crypt/byteArrayToHex\n                                    (digest (new Sha256) (new js/Uint8Array buffer)))]\n                       (async/go\n                         (async/>! c hash))))]\n       (when (instance? js/Blob blob)\n         (let [reader (new js/FileReader)]\n           (set!
