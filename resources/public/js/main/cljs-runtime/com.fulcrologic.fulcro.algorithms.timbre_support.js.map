The recommended use of these functions is as follows:\n\n  - Make sure you're using Binaryage devtools (on classpath. shadow-cljs will auto-add it when detected).\n  - IMPORTANT: Enable custom formatters in console settings for Chrome. This will print cljs data as cljs (instead of raw js).\n  - Make a development preload cljs file, and tell shadow-cljs to preload it.\n  - In the preload file, add something like this:\n\n  ```\n  (ns app.development-preload\n    (:require\n      [taoensso.timbre :as log]\n      [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.timbre-support :refer [console-appender prefix-output-fn]))\n\n  (log/set-level! :debug)\n  (log/merge-config! {:output-fn prefix-output-fn\n                      :appenders {:console (console-appender)}})\n  ```\n\n  and you'll get much more readable error messages in the js console.\n\n  NOTE: when logging errors, be sure to log the exception first. This is documented in timbre, but easy to miss:\n\n  ```\n  (try\n    ...\n    (catch :default ex\n      (log/error ex ...))\n  ```\n\n  See the development_preload.cljs and shadow-cljs.edn files in the latest Fulcro 3 template for an example.\n  \"\n(:require\n  [clojure.string :as str]))\n\n;; Taken mostly from timbre itself.

This appender uses the normal output-fn to generate the main\n  message, but it also does raw output of the original logging args so that devtools can format data structures.\n\n  Furthermore, if it detects an ExceptionInfo it will print the `ex-message` *after* so that you can see the real\n  message of the exception last in the console.
