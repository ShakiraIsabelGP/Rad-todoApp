A resolver also receives a separated map containing the environment information.\n\n     Here are some examples of how you can use the defresolver syntax to define resolvers:\n\n     The verbose example:\n\n         (pc/defresolver song-by-id [env {:acme.song/keys [id]}]\n           {::pc/input     #{:acme.song/id}\n            ::pc/output    [:acme.song/title :acme.song/duration :acme.song/tone]\n            ::pc/params    []\n            ::pc/transform identity}\n           (fetch-song env id))\n\n     The previous example demonstrates the usage of the most common options in defresolver.\n\n     But we don't need to write all of that, for example, instead of manually saying\n     the ::pc/input, we can let the defresolver infer it from the param destructuring, so\n     the following code works the same (::pc/params and ::pc/transform also removed, since\n     they were no-ops in this example):\n\n         (pc/defresolver song-by-id [env {:acme.song/keys [id]}]\n           {::pc/output [:acme.song/title :acme.song/duration :acme.song/tone]}\n           (fetch-song env id))\n\n     This makes for a cleaner write, now lets use this format and write a new example\n     resolver:\n\n         (pc/defresolver full-name [env {:acme.user/keys [first-name last-name]}]\n           {::pc/output [:acme.user/full-name]}\n           {:acme.user/full-name (str first-name \\\" \\\" last-name)})\n\n     The first thing we see is that we don't use env, so we can omit it.\n\n         (pc/defresolver full-name [{:acme.user/keys [first-name last-name]}]\n           {::pc/output [:acme.user/full-name]}\n           {:acme.user/full-name (str first-name \\\" \\\" last-name)})\n\n     Also, when the last expression of the defresolver is a map, it will infer the output\n     shape from it:\n\n         (pc/defresolver full-name [{:acme.user/keys [first-name last-name]}]\n           {:acme.user/full-name (str first-name \\\" \\\" last-name)})\n\n     You can always override the implicit input and output by setting on the configuration\n     map.\n\n     Standard options:\n\n       ::pc/output - description of resolver output, in EQL format\n       ::pc/input - description of resolver input, as a set\n       ::pc/params - description of resolver parameters, in EQL format\n       ::pc/transform - a function to transform the resolver configuration before instantiating the resolver\n\n     Note that any other option that you send to the resolver config will be stored in the\n     index and can be read from it at any time.\n     \"\n     {:arglists '([name docstring? arglist options? & body])}\n     [& args]\n     (let [{:keys [name arglist body docstring] :as params}\n           (-> (s/conform ::defresolver-args args)\n               (update :arglist normalize-arglist))\n           arglist' (s/unform ::operation-args arglist)\n           fqsym    (full-symbol name (str *ns*))\n           defdoc   (cond-> [] docstring (conj docstring))]\n       `(def ~name\n          ~@defdoc\n          (resolver '~fqsym ~(params->resolver-options params)\n            (fn ~name ~arglist'\n              ~@body))))))\n\n#?(:clj\n   (s/fdef defresolver\n     :args ::defresolver-args\n     :ret any?))\n\n; endregion\n\n(defn attr-alias-name [from to]\n  (symbol (str (munge (subs (str from) 1)) \"->\" (munge (subs (str to) 1)))))\n\n(defn alias-resolver\n  \"Create a resolver that will convert property `from` to a property `to` with\n  the same value.

The\n  default function will take the respective input and must return a map containing\n  any data you want to add, usually some nil keys to declare that value should not\n  require further lookup.\"\n  [{::keys [inputs key batch-default]} items]\n  (let [index         (group-by key items)\n        batch-default (or batch-default #(hash-map key (get % key)))]\n    (into [] (map (fn [input]\n                    (or (first (get index (get input key)))\n                        (batch-default input)))) inputs)))\n\n;; resolvers\n\n(def index-explorer-resolver\n  (resolver `index-explorer-resolver\n    {::output [:com.wsscode.pathom.viz.index-explorer/index]}\n    (fn [env _] {:com.wsscode.pathom.viz.index-explorer/index (get env ::indexes)})))\n\n(def indexes-resolver\n  (resolver `indexes-resolver\n    {::output [{::indexes\n                [::index-io ::index-oir ::idents ::autocomplete-ignore\n                 {::index-attributes\n                  [::attribute-id\n                   ::attr-leaf-in\n                   ::attr-branch-in\n                   ::attr-combinations\n                   ::attr-input-in\n                   ::attr-output-in\n                   ::attr-mutation-output-in\n                   ::attr-mutation-param-in\n                   ::attr-provides\n                   ::attr-reach-via]}\n                 {::index-resolvers\n                  [::sym ::input ::output ::params]}\n                 {::index-mutations\n                  [::sym ::output ::params]}]}]}\n    (fn [{::keys [indexes]} _]\n      {::indexes indexes})))\n\n(def resolver-weights-resolver\n  (resolver `resolver-weights-resolver\n    {::output [::resolver-weights]}\n    (fn [env _]\n      {::resolver-weights (some-> env ::resolver-weights deref)})))\n\n(def resolver-weights-sorted-resolver\n  (resolver `resolver-weights-sorted-resolver\n    {::output [::resolver-weights-sorted]}\n    (fn [env _]\n      {::resolver-weights-sorted\n       (some->> env ::resolver-weights deref (sort-by second #(compare %2 %)))})))\n\n(def resolver-weights-resolvers [resolver-weights-resolver resolver-weights-sorted-resolver])\n\n(def connect-resolvers [indexes-resolver resolver-weights-resolvers])\n\n;; plugins\n\n(defn connect-plugin\n  \"This plugin facilitates the connect setup in a parser.

Here are the available options to configure the plugin:\n\n  `::pc/indexes` - provide an index atom to be used, otherwise the plugin will create one\n  `::pc/register` - a resolver, mutation or sequence of resolvers/mutations to register in\n  the index\n  `::pc/pool-chan` - override the thread pool, use `nil` to disable thread pool feature (not recommended)\n\n  This plugin also looks for the key `::pc/register` in the other plugins used in the\n  parser configuration, this enable plugins to provide resolvers/mutations to be available\n  in your connect system.\n\n  By default this plugin will also register resolvers to provide the index itself, if\n  you for some reason need to hide it you can dissoc the `::pc/register` from the output\n  and they will not be available, but consider that doing so you lose the ability to\n  have introspection tools like Pathom Viz and Fulcro Inspect.\"\n  ([] (connect-plugin {}))\n  ([{::keys [indexes] :as env}]\n   (let [indexes   (or indexes (atom {}))\n         pool-chan (get env ::pool-chan)]\n     {::p/wrap-parser2\n      (fn connect-wrap-parser [parser {::p/keys [plugins]}]\n        (let [plugin-registry  (keep ::register plugins)\n              resolver-weights (atom {})]\n          (swap! indexes register [plugin-registry (get env ::register [])])\n          (fn [env tx]\n            (parser\n              (merge\n                {::resolver-dispatch resolver-dispatch-embedded\n                 ::mutate-dispatch   mutation-dispatch-embedded\n                 ::indexes           @indexes\n                 ::resolver-weights  resolver-weights\n                 ::pool-chan         pool-chan}\n                env) tx))))\n\n      ::indexes\n      indexes\n\n      ::register\n      connect-resolvers})))\n"]}
