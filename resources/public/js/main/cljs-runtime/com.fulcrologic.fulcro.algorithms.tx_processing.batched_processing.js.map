The instance of the component that should appear in the transaction env.\n  - `:refresh` - Vector containing idents (of components) and keywords (of props). Things that have changed and should be re-rendered\n    on screen. Only necessary when the underlying rendering algorithm won't auto-detect, such as when UI is derived from the\n    state of other components or outside of the directly queried props. Interpretation depends on the renderer selected:\n    The ident-optimized render treats these as \\\"extras\\\".\n  - `:only-refresh` - Vector of idents/keywords.  If the underlying rendering configured algorithm supports it: The\n    components using these are the *only* things that will be refreshed in the UI.\n    This can be used to avoid the overhead of looking for stale data when you know exactly what\n    you want to refresh on screen as an extra optimization. Idents are *not* checked against queries.\n\n  WARNING: `:only-refresh` can cause missed refreshes because rendering is debounced. If you are using this for\n           rapid-fire updates like drag-and-drop it is recommended that on the trailing edge (e.g. drop) of your sequence you\n           force a normal refresh via `app/render!`.\n\n  If the `options` include `:ref` (which comp/transact! sets), then it will be auto-included on the `:refresh` list.\n\n  NOTE: Fulcro 2 'follow-on reads' are supported and are added to the `:refresh` entries. Your choice of rendering\n  algorithm will influence their necessity.\n\n  Returns the transaction ID of the submitted transaction.\n  \"\n  ([app tx]\n   [:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/app ::txn/tx => ::txn/id]\n   (default-tx! app tx {}))\n  ([{:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/keys [runtime-atom] :as app} tx {:keys [synchronous?] :as options}]\n   [:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/app ::txn/tx ::txn/options => ::txn/id]\n   (if synchronous?\n     (transact-sync! app tx options)\n     (do\n       (schedule-activation! app)\n       (let [{:keys [refresh only-refresh ref] :as options} (merge {:optimistic? true} options)\n             follow-on-reads (into #{} (filter #(or (keyword? %) (eql/ident? %)) tx))\n             node            (tx-node tx options)\n             accumulate      (fn [r items] (into (set r) items))\n             refresh         (cond-> (set refresh)\n                               (seq follow-on-reads) (into follow-on-reads)\n                               ref (conj ref))]\n         (swap! runtime-atom (fn [s] (cond-> (update s ::txn/submission-queue (fn [v n] (conj (vec v) n)) node)\n                                       ;; refresh sets are cumulative because rendering is debounced\n                                       (seq refresh) (update :com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/to-refresh accumulate refresh)\n                                       (seq only-refresh) (update :com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/only-refresh accumulate only-refresh))))\n         (::txn/id node))))))\n\n(defn- abort-elements!\n  \"Abort any elements in the given send-queue that have the given abort id.\n\n  Aborting will cause the network to abort (which will report a result), or if the item is not yet active a\n  virtual result will still be sent for that node.\n\n  Returns a new send-queue that no longer contains the aborted nodes.\"\n  [{:keys [abort!] :as remote} send-queue abort-id]\n  (if abort!\n    (reduce\n      (fn [result {::txn/keys [active? result-handler] :as send-node}]\n        (let [aid (node-abort-id send-node)]\n          (cond\n            (not= aid abort-id) (do\n                                  (conj result send-node))\n            active?
