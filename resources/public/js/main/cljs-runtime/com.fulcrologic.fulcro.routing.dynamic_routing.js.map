The first argument is any live component\n  or the app.  The `timeouts-and-params` are as in `change-route`.\n\n  When possible (i.e. no circular references to components) you can maintain better code navigation by\n  generating `new-route` via `path-to`.  This will allow readers of your code to quickly jump to the actual\n  components that implement the targets when reading the code.\n\n  You may include the special keyword `:..` any number of times at the beginning of `new-route` to indicate the\n  parent(s) of `relative-class-or-instance`, which allows you to do relative routing to a sibling.\n\n  ```\n  (dr/change-route-relative this this [:.. \\\"sibling-pattern\\\"])\n  ```\n\n  Returns one of:\n\n  `:already-there` - The old and new route are the same, and there was no request to force an idempotent routing operation.\n  `:invalid` - The new route didn't evaluate to a valid location\n  `:denied` - One or more on-screen targets refused to allow the routing operation\n  `:routing` - The routing operation is in progress, but deferred operations may still delay the route becoming visible.\n  \"\n  ([this-or-app relative-class-or-instance new-route]\n   (change-route-relative! this-or-app relative-class-or-instance new-route {}))\n  ([app-or-comp relative-class-or-instance new-route timeouts-and-params]\n   (let [[relative-class-or-instance new-route] (evaluate-relative-path relative-class-or-instance new-route)\n         relative-class (if (rc/component? relative-class-or-instance)\n                          (comp/react-type relative-class-or-instance)\n                          relative-class-or-instance)\n         old-route      (current-route app-or-comp relative-class)\n         new-path       (proposed-new-path app-or-comp relative-class new-route timeouts-and-params)]\n     (cond\n       (and (= old-route new-route) (not (::force? timeouts-and-params)))\n       (do\n         (log/debug \"Request to change route, but path is the current route.
